# CORRECTED: AUTHENTIC CALL CONTENT EXTRACTION REPORT

## 🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION APPLIED

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:** Initially created AI-generated "enhanced" descriptions instead of extracting actual call content.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:** Replaced all AI-generated content with authentic extraction from real Fellow call transcripts and notes.

**RESULT:** Database now contains ONLY what was actually discussed in calls - NO assumptions, NO creative interpretations.
